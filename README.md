# MeasurementsUI
### Project Description
The purpose of this project is to create an interface between the actively changing 3D model world and the slow construction world. The reason this is done is because every day project engineers spend countless hours in document control of hand written notes by field personnel. This process essentially waste time and makes documentation unreliable as it is prone to several avenues were human error can interfere with the accuracy of the data. We live in the 21st century and we have the tools readily available to automate most of the process. I will document the experiences as I videotape while this project is built.


### Video 1: Calculation of Shapes available to scrap material
In the video, the user is selecting the different dimensions to be measured for the scrap wood (H|W|D). As the user measures, the phone receives the measurement and instantly distributes the measurement to the 3D model. The 3D model then uses Rhino Grasshopper (Visual Scripting) to plot and calculate the available shapes that can be cut from the scrap pieces. This is done in sync with the user taking measurements.
